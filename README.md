**Information**

This script is designed to automatically disable the sirens of an LEO vehicle and also automatically lock the door. 

If the vehicle has sirens and lights on, and if the officer exits the vehicle, it will stop the sirens keeping the lights on automatically and also lock the door. This can help prevent the vehicle from being stolen, or any FRP occuring.

If using vMenu lock, ensure to set the vehicle to your personal vehicle in order to ensure you do not get locked out. In the future, there will be updates adding our own custom vehicle lock script integrated into this to be more efficient. Join the discord to keep up with the updates or if you require further assistance.
